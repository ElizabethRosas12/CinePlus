Project description

This is a project that creates the development of a cinema, in the first window we have the login, which shows that you must enter a username and a password, if both are correct, it will open to the next window called box office, in this window the user can choose which movie he wants to see, the time of the movie and in which room, also the price of the tickets either for adults or for minors, you can choose the quantity. Finishing choosing if you click on the next button, you will be able to see the options you chose including the total price of the tickets, if you click on the clean button, you will delete all the changes made before.

Moving on to the next window after accepting the purchase, we go to the Candy window, in this we can choose which combo to buy, we have the price of the combos, how many combos to buy, in addition the price also appears for all the combos once already chosen, if we give it a clean button it will clean the changes. In the QR code we can access the window of personalized combos, what it does is that we can freely choose our own combo individually, whether popcorn, soda, etc.# CinePlus

Instructions to execute the project

In order to run our "CinePlus" project we will open our folder created with all the documents and files that we have added to that project, we will open this folder in visual studio code, which will already have downloaded wxglade. On the left side all our documents should appear, to see the wxglade design window, we will press ctrl+ñ to show the terminal, in the terminal we will place cd C:\Users\Pc\Downloads\wxglade; and then Python.wxglade; (pc and downloads will depend on the computer and file where wxglade is installed). Through the code we will execute our code made and edited to show everything that the user can do in said project, such as registering to have a history in our cinema account, as well as selecting your tickets, seats, schedule and number of people who will enjoy our movies; you can also choose the combos in our candy window created for the user, where we will show different combos to choose from, individual products and products to combine; so it will also show a screen where all the products I select will be, in a window that will be displayed as a ticket, there you can Cancel or accept your order, this project will be executed thanks to the modification that was made by means of visual studio code, Python and wxglade.
